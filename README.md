3DViewer
========

This MATLAB program creates a simple planar 3D scene from a single photograph (or a painting). 
By specifying the back plane and the vanishing point, it is able to divide the photograph into five planes 
(floor, ceiling, left, right, back) and compute homography matrices to restore each plane. 
From that, a 3D scene is built. Feel free to walk into the scene.
